We built the bili light incubator to cure newborns in developing nations who are suffering from jaundice. Jaundice is a disease common in newborns that results when a child is unable to breakdown the protein bilirubin in the bloodstream. Left untreated, jaundice can result in death within a month. Fortunately, this disease can easily be treated by bili light phototherapy, which exposes children to a specific light wavelength that decomposes the excess bilirubin. 

The code for the incubator integrates the electrical componenets in our incubator including fans, the heating element,temperature probes, bili lights, and the LCD screen.
